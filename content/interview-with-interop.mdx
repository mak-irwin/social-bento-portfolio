Last October I had the opportunity to represent TD Securities and attend the annual [Interop.io](http://Interop.io) client forum in New York City. This event hosts the organizations (ie. JP-Morgan, Fidelity, TD Securities, and more) that utilize the technology and provides an opportunity to share learnings and strategies under chatham house rule.

This year I attended as a panelist speaker and after the main event was invited to participate in a short interview you can view below. Always a pleasure getting to connect with the [Interop.io](http://Interop.io) team and I hope to see everyone again this year!
