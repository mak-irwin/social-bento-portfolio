# My (Current) Personal Portfolio

Built simply with:
- Next 14
- CSS Modules
- MDX Remote
- React Three Fiber

Inspired by social media profiles and the bento box grid aesthetic, I wanted something that was minimal but still had enough to expand on and keep visually interesting. I'm quite pleased with how it turned out and I anticipate additional functionality being added in the future as the content grows.
